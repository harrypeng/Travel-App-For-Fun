# Travel-For-Fun-App

This is a personal project create and maintained by Harry/Tony/Joy, who are three developers eager to understand more about nodejs + angular2.
This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).

## Development server

Run `npm run build` to build the angular typescript code, and start a simple express server hosted on `http://localhost:8080/`. If this
is your first time download the code, you probably need to setup node js first.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Please do not commit any code under
`dist/` and `node_modules/` to the github directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
